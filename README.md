📊 **Movie Genre Data Analysis — Full Project Description**

📘 **Project Overview** 

This project performs an in-depth analytical study of movie genres using a dataset containing key attributes such as popularity, budget, revenue, vote averages, and release year. The objective is to uncover meaningful genre-level insights by examining financial performance, audience reception, and production trends.
Using Python, pandas and seaborn, the dataset is cleaned, transformed, and expanded by splitting multi-genre entries and calculating key metrics such as profit. The final dataset enables rich comparative analysis across genres and supports data-driven conclusions about which types of films perform best commercially and critically.

🎯 **Business Problem** 

The movie industry invests billions into content development. Studios, streaming services, and investors need to understand which genres deliver consistent performance across:
- Profitability
- Popularity
- Critical reception
- Volume/output

However, movie datasets often store multiple genres in a single field, making genre-specific analytics difficult. This project addresses these problems by restructuring the dataset and performing targeted statistical analysis to help decision-makers prioritize which genres to fund, market, or expand. 

🛠 **Tech Stack** 

Programming & Analysis:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

- Removing duplicates 
- Splitting multi-value genre fields 
- Dataset restructuring for genre-level analysis 

📌 **Research Questions (Q)**

- Which genres are the most common? 
(Based on number of movies produced.)
- Which genres have the highest average budget and revenue? 
(Identifying high-cost and high-earning categories.)
- Which genres achieve the highest average popularity? 
(Capturing audience interest and engagement.)
-Which genres have high avg. Profit? 
(Identify the most financially successful genres)
- Which genres have the largest number of movies with a vote average ≥ 8? 
(Determining critically acclaimed genres.)

📌 **Research Hypotheses (H)**

- Movies with high vote averages generate higher profit and revenue. 
(Critical success correlates with financial success.)
- Movies with high popularity generate higher profit and revenue. 
(Audience interest leads to box office or streaming returns.)
- Highly budgeted movies return higher revenue and profit. 
(Studios invest big in genres expected to perform well.)
- Higher budgets correlate with higher popularity. 
(More marketing + production quality = more audience engagement.)
